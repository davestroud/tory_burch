Proof of Concept (POC)

1. Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization
    * Predict which clothing items will be in high demand based on historical data, trends, and seasonality.
    * Minimize overstock and understock issues

2. Data 
    * Work with the Margo/fashion200k

    * What is the best way to delete the data?
    * What is the best way to join the data?
    * What is the best way to aggregate the data?
    * What is the best way to visualize the data?
        * Pinecone will serve as the vector database
        * SQL will serve as the relational database? By way of Athena?

4.   AWS Glue
    * What is the best way to use AWS Glue to load the data into the database?
    * What is the best way to use AWS Glue to query the data?
    * What is the best way to use AWS Glue to update the data?
    * What is the best way to use AWS Glue to delete the data?
    * What is the best way to use AWS Glue to join the data?
    * What is the best way to use AWS Glue to aggregate the data?
    * What is the best way to use AWS Glue to visualize the data?
    * Look at the AWS Glue Studio
